# Vehicle-cluster-analysis

A metropolis has various means of public transport used to travel from one place to another. One of the most common means are taxi and
a rickshaws. They all run day and night in the various parts of the city. The aim of this assignment/project is to know the regions where several
rickshaws/taxis form a group and serve as a local staypoint for the people. 

Therefore, for this project the data we have is the discretized spatial and temporal information regarding the location of each individual cab/taxi 
for all the privately owned cabs in the city. This data spans over several months. Our aim is to determine the regions in a city where privately 
owned cabs cluster and form a local staypoint for a significant period of time using a modified version of Birch-cluster algorithm. By obtaining this
data government can build newer stations for more convienient public transport and it can also be used to determine the nearest location where one 
can get a cab or rickshaw conveniently at any given moment of time.
